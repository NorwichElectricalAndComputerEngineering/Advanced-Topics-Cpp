# Intro-to-Classes-CPP
The first sample code is simpleClass.cpp
A drone class is created instantiated and drone1 is used to search for a randomly generated target. 
Starting position of the drone is always known. Move using '2'down '4'left '6'right and '8'up.
Search for the target and get a completion message.
RSSI is determined using the distance vector. 

Tree game is a project directory made into a header file for game creation in visual studio.
Timber is the game itself and uses the library. Currently the game can begin. The player can move.
Clouds and Bee fly around.
Bee is enemy no collision bitmask is in place yet.
Simple introduction to building a game with sprites.
Play around with timing my computer was sensitive with it. 

polymorphism.cpp is a file that uses example code to explain polymorphism overloading functions to rename them.
 Both the Triangle and Rectangle class are derived classes of the Shape class.
Note that both Rectangle Shape and Triangle class have a function called area. By instantiating a pointer class with reference
to Shape the code overloads the function by storing the address of either the Rectangle instantiation or the Triangle instantiation.
The call the function from the shape instantiation to print the corresponding function call.
