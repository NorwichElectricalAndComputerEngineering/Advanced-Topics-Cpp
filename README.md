# Intro-to-Classes-CPP
The first sample code is simpleClass.cpp
A drone class is created instantiated and drone1 is used to search for a randomly generated target. 
Starting position of the drone is always known. Move using '2'down '4'left '6'right and '8'up.
Search for the target and get a completion message.
RSSI is determined using the distance vector.
